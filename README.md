# 🎵 AI-Generated Music in Google Colab  

This project explores **AI-generated music** using deep learning models like **Magenta** and **Riffusion**.  
The models generate **music compositions** based on different **styles, moods, and input parameters**.

---

## 📌 Features
✅ **🎼 Generate Melodies** – Uses **Magenta’s Melody RNN** to create MIDI sequences.  
✅ **🎵 AI-Composed Music** – Generates full music pieces using AI-generated patterns.  
✅ **🎧 Convert MIDI to Audio** – Converts and plays AI-generated music using **FluidSynth**.  
✅ **📝 Text-to-Music** – Uses **Riffusion** to generate music **directly from text prompts**.  
✅ **🔊 Listen in Google Colab** – Play the generated **music within the notebook**.
